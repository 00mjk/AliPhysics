The EMCal OADB files have been moved to the EOS directory /eos/experiment/alice/analysis-data/OADB/EMCAL which is accessible via lxplus.
Analysis tasks can access these files via, for example: AliDataFile::GetFileNameOADB("EMCAL/EMCALTimeL1PhaseCalib.root") which has been implemented into the Tender and the Correction Framework as well as most analysis tasks in AliPhysics.
If you want to have the OADB files locally, you can download them from lxplus via:
export OADB_PATH=/path/to/my/local/oadb
rsync -av --delete cern_user@lxplus.cern.ch:/eos/experiment/alice/analysis-data/ $OADB_PATH/
In order for local tests to work properly, please add the OADB_PATH to your bashrc or similar.

In addition, a short history of changes to the files in EOS will be listed here:
